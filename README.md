## Hello there 👋

I am Tirthankar, a 3rd year BS Physics student at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the intersection of astrophysics and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Physics Informed Neural Networks, Normalizing Flows and Graph Neural Networks
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to computational astrophysics (like hydrodynamical simulations) or AstroML projects (like foundational models)
