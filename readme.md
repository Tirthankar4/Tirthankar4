- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tirthankar4, a physics student with experience in programming with python
- 👀 I’m interested in computational astrophysics and nuclear physics and scientific machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning, PINNs and libraries in python for scientific research (lightkurve, astropy, astroml etc) and other tools like ROOT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific research using python and machine learning
  
     Have a nice day
